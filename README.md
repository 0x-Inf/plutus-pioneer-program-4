# Welcome to the Plutus Pioneers Program

## Program Description

The Plutus Pioneer Program (PPP) is a course provided by [the IOG Education Team](https://iohk.io/team/#team=education) to recruit and train software developers in Plutus, the native smart contract language for the Cardano ecosystem.

People who join this program will become part of a learning community with access to courses that teach them the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. In addition, this program is highly interactive, with weekly lessons, exercises, Q&A sessions, and exclusive access to the creators and key experts in the language.

## Prior Experience Required

This program is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. Some prior knowledge of Haskell or functional programming is also recommended. Plutus is heavily based on Haskell and includes advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems.

Before registering for this course, we recommend you to visit the [Learn Haskell section](prework/learn-haskell.md).

## Course Structure

In this course, you'll learn and gain hands-on experience with the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. The course modules will cover the building blocks of these languages. You'll also learn about the [Extended UTXO model](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/eutxo-explainer) while working with Plutus on and off the chain, minting policies, state machines, the Plutus application framework, as well as some case studies and practical exercises.

At a glance, this course covers the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including:

* Functions and data types

* Type classes

* Monads

* Template Haskell

* Using the Plutus Playground

* Extended UTXO model (EUTXO)

* Working with Plutus (on and off the chain)

* Minting policies

* State machines

* The Plutus application framework (PAF)

* The Plutus application backend (PAB)

* Some case studies and practical exercises

### Cardano Smart Contracts Developer Certification

After finishing the course, those participants who successfully complete the entire program will receive a certificate as **Cardano Smart Contracts Developer**. Certificates will be represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. The participants can demonstrate their qualifications by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.
