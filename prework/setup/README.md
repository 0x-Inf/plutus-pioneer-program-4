# Working Environment Set Up

## Overview

To follow up on this program's activities, you should set up your working environment to start successfully since the first lesson.

In this program, you'll extensively use Plutus to create Cardano applications. To do so, you can use a web development environment like [demeter.run](https://demeter.run/) or set up a local working environment on your computer.

The web development environment allows you to create a Cardano application from your browser, and no further installations are required. This is a suitable option if you have a reliable internet connection.

On the other hand, you must install all the required libraries and dependencies to create a local working environment. You should use a Linux based operating system (OS), either as your primary OS, as a virtual machine, or using the Windows Linux Subsystem. This option is recommended if your internet connection speed is lower than 10 MB.

Regardless of your internet connection speed, we encourage you to jump into installing a local working environment.

In this section, we provide the following environment setup guides:

* [Using Demeter](demeter.md). This guide shows how to set up an account to use demeter.run and how to set up the environment required for this course.
* [Using Ubuntu](ubuntu.md). This guide shows you how to create a local working environment using Ubuntu Desktop. You can use this guide to set up a computer with Ubuntu as a main OS or an Ubuntu virtual machine.
* [Using the Windows Linux Subsystem (WLS)](windows.md). This guide shows you how to set up a local virtual environment using Windows as a host OS and the WLS having Ubuntu as OS.
