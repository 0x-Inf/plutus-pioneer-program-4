= Learn Haskell

https://www.haskell.org/[Haskell] is a purely functional, statically typed, and lazy programming language. It has a robust, static type system with type inference and supports higher-order programming and pattern matching. Haskell also has a wide range of libraries, making it an excellent choice for the development of reliable, robust, and efficient applications. Haskell is an open source language and provides a platform for experimenting with functional programming. 

As Plutus is based largely on Haskell, having some prior experience with Haskell (or another functional programming language) will be very helpful. As a minimum, you should have some programming experience and a mathematical and technical mindset.

During this program, you'll learn the fundamentals of Haskell that are required to use Plutus to create smart contracts for Cardano. In addition, if you want to start with Haskell in advance of the Plutus Pioneers Program, we provide a self-paced Haskell Bootcamp course introducing you to Haskell. For every lesson on this Bootcamp, we provide a video lecture, an interactive coding environment based on Jupyter notebooks, and homework assignments to put your new Haskell skills into action.

You can take this course completely free and review the detailed syllabus using the following links:

* https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course[The “Haskell Bootcamp Course” on GitHub]

* https://iohk.instructure.com/courses/141[The “Haskell Bootcamp Course” in our e-learning platform]

Both resources offer the same learning content; the main difference is that if you get enrolled in our e-learning platform, you can share your questions and interact with other learners by using the discussion forums provided for each lesson. For both options, you can also hang out and discuss with other students through the https://discord.gg/inputoutput[IOG's technical community on Discord] by checking out the `#ask-haskell` channel.

This course is offered in English; if you are a Spanish speaker and want to contribute to translating the course, we encourage you to fork the GitHub repository and share your contributions through a pull request.
