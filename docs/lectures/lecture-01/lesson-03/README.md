### Frequently Asked Questions

<details>

<summary>What is the difference between native assets and NFTs?</summary>

From a technical point of view, NFTs are the same as native assets. But some additional characteristics make a native asset truly an NFT:

* As the name states - it must be 'non-fungible. This means you need to have unique identifiers or attributes attached to a token to make it distinguishable from others.
* Most of the time, NFT's should live on the chain forever. Therefore we need some mechanism to ensure an NFT stays unique and can not be duplicated.
