= Welcome to the Plutus Pioneers Program

== Program Description

The Plutus Pioneer Program (PPP) is a course provided by the IOG Education Team to recruit and train software developers in Plutus, the native smart contract language for the Cardano ecosystem.

People who join this program will become part of a learning community with access to courses that teach them the core principles of how to code in Plutus, Plutus Tx, and the Cardano-cli. 

This program is highly interactive, with weekly lessons, exercises, live Q&A sessions, and exclusive access to the creators and key experts in the Cardano ecosystem.

== Prior Experience Required

This program is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. Some prior knowledge of Haskell or functional programming is also recommended. Plutus is heavily based on Haskell and includes advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems.

To get started with Haskell before registering for this course, we recommend you to visit the xref:docs/prework/learn-haskell.adoc[Learn Haskell section].

== Course Structure

This program involves approximately ten hours a week of your time and efforts during ten weeks. It covers the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including:

* Setting your Development Environment

* Introduction to ecosystem and Theoretical Foundations

* Introduction to PlutusTx and Cardano-cli

* Parameterized Validators

* Native tokens, NFTs, and Minting

* Off-chain code

* Testing Plutus smart contracts

* Working with Marlowe and Plutus

* Staking.

* Interoperability of Cardano with Sidechains

== Cardano Smart Contracts Developer Certification

After finishing the course, those participants who successfully complete the entire program will receive a certificate as **Cardano Smart Contracts Developer**. Certificates will be represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. The participants can demonstrate their qualifications by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.
